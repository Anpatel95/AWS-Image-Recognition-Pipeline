![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aa45362-b118-4656-8239-64f1ca6cf5c6)

## Purpose

This project will show how to use the Amazon AWS cloud platform and develop an AWS application utilizing existing cloud services. Through this project, you will learn

1. How to create Virtual Machines (VMs) using EC2 instances in the AWS cloud.
2. How to use cloud storage (S3) in your applications.
3. How to facilitate communication between VMs using a queue service (SQS).
4. How to program distributed applications in Java on Linux VMs in the cloud.
5. How to use a machine learning service (AWS Rekognition) for image analysis in the cloud.

## Description

The project involves building an image recognition pipeline in AWS, using the following components:

- **EC2 Instances**: Two Amazon Linux VMs for distributed processing.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Used to store images and application data.
- **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Enables communication between the EC2 instances.
- **AWS Rekognition**: A machine learning service that provides image recognition capabilities.

The entire application is developed in **Java** on **Amazon Linux VMs**. For further details on the implementation, please refer to the accompanying figure above.

> **Note**: The figure provides a detailed view of the architecture and workflow of the application.
